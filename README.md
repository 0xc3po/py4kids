Welcome to py4kids!

If you are reading this, I would like to thank you for playing your part in ensuring computational thinking is passed down to the next generations, who will have to carry the tech of today into tomorrow!

This course is intended to be an introduction to Python programming for children. It is not exhaustive by any means, and A LOT of the core functionalities of the language are excluded. As directories are added for grades beyond elementary, the content will become increasingly rigorous, culminating into a full Python course for high school students.

The method applied by this course is a hands-on, break first approach. The actual process of writing a function or program is dirty and creative. We believe the clean approach applied by most coding programs fails to teach the student the ART of programming, which involves an immense amount of debugging. There is no better feeling than getting something right after n attempts and failures. That feeling reinforces the concepts that were learned during the process and motivates the programmer to learn further concepts and techniques. Therefore, we introduce students to broken functions and errors right out of the gates. All concepts are introduced with the following pattern:

right - wrong(make wrong) - make right

The concept is introduced using an example given in the correct format(right). Then, the student is asked to replicate the concept using their own unique data and structure. The student is intended to encounter errors during this process(wrong). Finally, the student must attempt to debug individually(right). If they are unable to correct their code individually, the instructor or another peer is to help them correct the problem step-by-step. If the student is successful on their first attempt, they are asked to create an error (make wrong). Advanced students can be asked to create multiple error types and provide a report on their findings as a substitute or supplement to the method. 

This method more closely simulates the ecosystem in which the student will one day be writing their own scripts. When they eventually become a programmer(professional or amateur), they will be referencing documentation, Googling forum answers and blog posts, then customizing the findings into their codebase. Using this method will prepare the student for the back-and-forth process of writing functions, instead of merely showing them the best way to execute a function. As such, we exchange the focus from memorizing the right syntax, to memorizing how to find the right syntax. 

The materials are designed in such a manner that no knowledge of programming or Python are required by the educator. However, if you are an educator and wish to understand the Python programming language, or programming in general, MIT's free course, 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python, is highly recommended. All of the material covered here is explained in full MIT-level depth in that course. The lectures are accessible on their website or on YouTube by simply searching: 'MIT 6.0001'.
